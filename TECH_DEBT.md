## Implementation Patterns & Best Practices

### Recommended Helper Patterns

**Resource Management Helper:**
```go
func withStore(cfg *config.Config, fn func(*storage.Store) error) error {
    store, err := getStore(cfg)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer store.Close()
    return fn(store)
}
```

**Error Propagation:**
```go
// Replace: log.Fatal(err)
// With: return fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)
```

**Concurrent Operations:**
```go
// Use bounded concurrency
const maxConcurrentRefresh = 5
semaphore := make(chan struct{}, maxConcurrentRefresh)
```

- Clean separation of concerns (TUI, storage, feed management)
